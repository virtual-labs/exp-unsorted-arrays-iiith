                "a": "An element is copied linearly in another array until the required element comes up.",

                "a": "There is no need to create a new array for searching an element.",

                "c": "In the worst case, each element is traversed at least once. Thus time complexity is O(N) i.e. the size of the array."

            "explanations": {
                "a": "In the best case, when the required element is in the beginning of the array, linear search just needs to access the first element of the array. Hence the resulting time complexity is constant."

                "a": "Time taken to find an element is more as compared to other searching algorithms",
                "b": "Space complexity to perform a linear search increases the memory overhead",

            "correctAnswer": "a",
            "explanations": {
                "a": "Yes, there are other search algorithms available which perform much better than linear search.",
                "b": "There is no role of space complexity while performing linear search. Since we are assessing and comparing the elements in the array, instead of storing anything.",
                "c": "It is very easy to implement linear search, as it requires just a loop and an if condition to check for the element."
