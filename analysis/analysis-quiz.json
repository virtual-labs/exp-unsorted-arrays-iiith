                "d": "If the element is not present in the array, then it would become the worst case scenario. Hence, here the best case will be equal to the worst case, and thus floor(log(N) + 1) iterations will be required."

                "b": "We can assume a best case scenario of finding an element which is smaller than the shortest element present in the array. Hence with the knowledge of the array being sorted, the modified algorithm will stop iterating after checking the first element."
