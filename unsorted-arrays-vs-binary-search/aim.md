### Estimated Time

1 hour

### Learning Objectives of the Experiment
In this experiment, you will be able to do the following:

   - Given an unsorted array of numbers, search for a given number in the array using linear search.
   - Speed up the searching process by sorting the array and using binary search instead.
   - Demonstrate knowledge of time complexity of Linear and Binary Search by counting the number of operations required in both of the algorithms.
   - Understand the applications of searching and the need for faster searching.
